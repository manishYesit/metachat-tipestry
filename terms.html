                                                or provision of the TOS, such failure shall not constitute a waiver of
                                                such right or provision. If any provision of this TOS is found by a
                                                court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless
                                                agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'
                                                intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of
                                                the TOS remain in full force and effect.
